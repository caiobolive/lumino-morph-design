# Lumino Morph Design

This project is supposed to be a Component Library that fulfills it's purpose while also allowing for a lot of stylization and theming

The package will be imported via npm and you will be able to generate components and choose a style (Regular, Clean, Glassmorphism, Neon) and also its colors (Primary, Secondary, etc)

Technologies used: React + TypeScript + Vite

This project is on its starting phase, please be mindful

Here is a cool animation I did for the Logo:

This was made using a multi layered svg and the framer-motion package
